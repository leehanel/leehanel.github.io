I'm looking at using [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/), [Dropbox](www.dropbox.com) and [incron](http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=incron&page=faq&lang=en) to automate jekyll blog deployments.

I was given the idea by [This](http://www.evanlovely.com/notes/about-this-jekyll-site/)blog post, although I don't have a Mac, so I'll be replacing Hazel with incron.
