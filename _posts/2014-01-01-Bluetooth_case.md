Got [this](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Built-In-Stand-920-003402/dp/B0054JE706/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1388440093&sr=8-11&keywords=logitec+bluetooth+keyboard) keyboard and am now testing for use with my ipad.  This could totally change my usage of the ipad.

Seems to work awsome with panic's prompt, but need to figure out how to remap some keys so I can have the escape key on the keyboard for vi.
